cabal-version:       >= 1.6
synopsis:            Portable temporary file and directory support for Windows and Unix, based on code from Cabal
description:         The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base library are quite limited. The unixutils
                     package contains some good ones, but they aren't portable to Windows.
                     
                     This library just repackages the Cabal implementations of its own temporary file and folder functions so that
                     you can use them without linking against Cabal or depending on it being installed.
